https://gitingest.com/,Gitingest,"Gitingest is a specialized tool that converts any Git repository into a concise, prompt-friendly text digest, optimized for feeding codebases into large language models (LLMs). Unlike generic code analysis tools, it focuses on simplifying repositories into lightweight, structured text outputs, making it ideal for AI-driven development, documentation, or research. Users can customize the digest by including or excluding specific files and filtering by size (e.g., files under 50KB). The service supports popular repositories like FastAPI, Flask, and Excalidraw, and allows direct URL conversion by replacing ""hub"" with ""ingest"" in GitHub links. Designed for developers and researchers, Gitingest enhances LLM compatibility by stripping away unnecessary metadata, ensuring clean, usable input for AI applications. Its simplicity and focus on LLM integration set it apart from traditional code exploration tools.","GitHub, codebase, LLM, repository, prompt-friendly, extension, text digest",2025-03-27T13:08:48.608Z,false,C:\Users\julia\Desktop\bookmark-manager\app_data\screenshots\1743080909635_aHR0cHM6Ly.png
